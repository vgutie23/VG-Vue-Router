    Our family-owned coffee shop opened in 2012. It was started in hopes of
    creating a positive, peaceful environment for the community. We enjoy giving
    the best customer service to all of our guests and like to promote a nice,
    friendly environment. We provide free Wi-Fi and our coffee is always fresh!
    We have dedicated ourselves to serving high-quality coffee with affordable
    pricing. We also value customer feedback so please feel free to express any
    comments or concerns if you come and visit us, we are always looking for
    ways to improve!
